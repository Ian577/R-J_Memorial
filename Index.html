    <p>     On Thursday, July 29, 1595, Romeo Montague (16), and Juliet Capulet (13), a young married couple, died.</p>
    <br>
    <p>     Romeo was born March 15, 1579, in Verona, Italy, to Lord and Lady Montague. In 1560 he won the award for best young swordsman in Verona. He loved practicing his sword fighting with his best friend, Mercutio (deceased). On Monday, July 26, 1595, just three days ago, he married Juliet Capulet. They loved each other despite their parents' grudges, and had to marry in secret. He always got along with (almost) everyone and was known for his charm.</p>
    <br>
    <p>     He is preceded in death by his best friend Mercutio. He is survived by his Mother (Lady Montague), Father (Lord Montague), and cousin (Benvolio).</p>
    <br>
    <p>     Juliet was born on February 17, 1582, in Verona, to Lord, and Lady Capulet. She loved to be with her cousin Tybalt (deceased). She was always kind and known for her ability to make anyone smile.</p>
    <br>
    <p>     She is preceded in death by her cousin Tybalt, and is survived by her Mother (Lady Capulet), and her father (Lord Capulet).</p>
    <br>
    <p>     A funeral service will be held on Saturday, July 31, 1595, at Friar John's cell, at 1:15 PM. Both Families have decided to put up statues of their children, to honor them. Donations, and flowers are being accepted.</p>
