He loved practicing his sword fighting with his best friend, Mercutio (deceased). On Monday, July 26, 1595, just three days ago, he married Juliet Capulet. They loved each other despite their parents' grudges, and had to marry in secret. He always got along with (almost) everyone and was known for his charm.</p>
